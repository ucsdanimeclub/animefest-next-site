It combines compelling characters, a wonderful story, fluid and dynamic art, interesting paneling, a complex power system that has tons to expand on, and deep themes that tie back to real-world issues. In my panel, I will go over exactly how these, and more, are presented in the series, and explain why they combined make Kagurabachi the best newgen manga. Furthermore, I will touch on its excellent reception worldwide, such as the awards it\u2019s won, the staggering amount of sales it has achieved in a short time, and the public cry for an anime adaptation.
